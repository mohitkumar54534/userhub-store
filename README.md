The User Hub Store System is a MERN-based CRUD application designed for efficiently managing user data in a store setting. Using MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for the server, React for the interface, and Node.js for server-side operations, the system enables seamless user profile creation, retrieval, dynamic updates, and deletions. Its user-friendly interface allows quick searches by name and gender, ensuring effective data management. The MERN technology stack ensures a responsive and reliable solution for maintaining accurate user information in a store environment.
The project is deployed using Render for the backend and Netlify for the frontend. This means that the server-side (backend) of the application is hosted on Render, while the client-side (frontend) is hosted on Netlify. This deployment setup allows for efficient and reliable hosting of both the server and the user interface.
